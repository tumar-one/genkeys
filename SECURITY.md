## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in this project, please help keep the community safe by reporting it responsibly:

1. **Do not** open a public GitHub issue for security-related problems.  
2. Instead, please email: **[info@tumar.one]** 
3. You can expect an acknowledgment within **48 hours**, and a more detailed response within **5–7 business days**, depending on investigation.  

### What happens next?
- If confirmed, we will work on a fix and release a patched version as quickly as possible.  
- Once a fix is available, we’ll disclose the vulnerability responsibly and credit the reporter (unless anonymity is requested).  
- If the report is declined (e.g., out of scope), we’ll explain why.
